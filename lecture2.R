# Lecture 2.  Hispanic Community Health Study: HCHS/SOL dataset

## Ok, so this is an lecture about HCHS/SOL dataset
## I can't get much only reading the slides, although having a lot of 
## information in them.
## I don't know what is the point they are trying to make, 
## neither what is the takehome message.

# Some general information about the HCHS/SOL dataset:
## 1. Growing community of Latinos in US
## 2. N=16415 participaints
## 3. Sampling based in four US cities
## 4. It is a longitudinal study (follow up interviews are done)
## 5. There's a list of phenotypes. Below, two that appears to caught attention 
#### 5.a Prevalent and incident pulmonary diagnoses + exacerbations
#### 5.b Pulmonary Function Testing (basal and post-bronchodilator)
## 6. Participants self-identified with 6 different "ancestries"
#### 6.a Central American
#### 6.b Cuban
#### 6.c Dominican
#### 6.d Mexican
#### 6.e Puerto Rican
#### 6.f South American
#### 6.g Other/Multiple
## 7. They give importance about asthma...
#### 7.a So they throw us a bunch of info about asthma
#### 7.b Apparently, there's difference in asthma prevalence between Mexican and Puerto Ricans
## 8. They also show three approaches used in HCHS/SOL, but not relevant enough for me to type it (maybe?)

# And I think that's the lecture about the HCHS/SOL dataset!
